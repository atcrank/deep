Immediate goals
 - additional methods on each element (show help string from obj.__doc__ for example) (tick, completed)
 - make ordered relationship elements (a tree subclass)  (MP_Node index is already ordered) (tick, learned something)
 - use content types to make the content item generic  (easy enough except excluding self-reference)
 - parameterise(?) parent and child html tags. (Not possible in Django Template Language, not desirable for security.  Limited to selecting alternate templates?)
 - user-awareness and per object group-permissions
 - page and sub-page tree
 - django-ninja api setup
 - caching - adding user will slow things down
